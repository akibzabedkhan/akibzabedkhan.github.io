# About Me
Hello! I am Md Akib Zabed Khan, an Assistant Professor of the School of Engineering and Computing at Christopher Newport University (CNU), Newport News, VA, USA. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences (KFSCIS) at Florida International University (FIU), Miami, FL, USA, in August 2025. I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. I also worked as a Lecturer for three years (2019 - 2021) in two different universities in Bangladesh.

My research interests include Educational Data Mining, Learning Analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I utilize real-world educational data to design AI-driven models that improve student learning experiences and academic outcomes. Specifically, my work focuses on developing recommender systems, predictive tools, and adaptive intelligent tutoring systems that provide personalized support for students (e.g, in their course/major selections), while also assisting teachers and administrators in facilitating the learning process.
