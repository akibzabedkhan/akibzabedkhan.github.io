# About Me
Hello! I am Md Akib Zabed Khan, an Assistant Professor of the School of Engineering and Computing at Christopher Newport University, Newport News, VA, USA. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences at Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA, in August 2025. I completed my M.Sc. and B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Jahangirnagar University, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

My research interests include Educational Data Mining, Learning Analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In short, I leverage real-world educational data to develop AI-based models that enhance studentsâ€™ learning experiences and improve academic performance. My work spans recommender systems, predictive tools, and adaptive intelligent tutoring systems, designed not only to provide personalized support for students (e.g, in their course/major selections, tracing knowledge-level to recommend next learning topics) but also to assist teachers and administrators in facilitating the learning process.
